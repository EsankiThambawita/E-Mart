# Stage 2 :- Navigating a Repository Crisis: Safeguarding Project Integrity and Continuity

> **Team Leader - Esanki Thambawita**

**Date: April 11, 2024**

**Challenge:** On April 10th, a team member discovered a virus on their computer, which had unknowingly led to infected files being pushed to the old repository.

**How it was overcome:**

1.  **Immediate Response:** As the team leader, immediate action was taken. Security scans were conducted on all team computers, and project files were backed up to prevent further spread of the virus.
    
2.  **Repository Scans:** Utilizing GitHub actions and online tools such as VirusTotal, comprehensive scans were performed on the repository URL to identify and isolate any infected files.
    
3.  **Commit Reversion:** Commits made by the team member suspected of contributing infected files were reverted back to the point when the virus was suspected to have been introduced. This was done to mitigate any potential risks to the project's integrity.
    
4.  **Decision to Stop Using Old Repository:** Despite efforts to contain the situation,  I consulted with the team, and made the decision to discontinue the use of the old repository to ensure the project's security. A new repository was created as a safer alternative.
    
5.  **Transfer to New Repository:** All frontend implementation files were migrated to the new repository to continue project development in a secure environment.
    
6.  **Documentation of Evidence:** Screenshots of commits, pull requests, and branches from the old repository were taken as evidence of the team's daily contributions.
    
7.  **Deadline Extension:** To accommodate the transition to the new repository without compromising quality, the team leader extended the deadline for completing the frontend implementation. This allowed for thorough testing and uploading of files to the new repository without rushing or making mistakes.
